# Development-and-Non-Development-Expenditure-Aggregate

1. Understanding the Concept

- Development Expenditure: Spending that directly contributes to economic growth, infrastructure, education, health, social welfare, agriculture, and industrial development.
- Non-Development Expenditure: Spending that maintains government functioning but does not directly add to growth, like defense, police, pensions, subsidies, interest payments, and administration.

2. Key Objectives of Analysis

- Compare trends of development vs. non-development expenditure over time.
- Understand whether spending is more growth-oriented or maintenance-oriented.
- Study the fiscal priorities of the government.
- Identify whether rising non-development expenditure is crowding out development projects.

3. Data Analysis Angles

- Time Series Analysis: Growth rate of both categories over years.
- Percentage Share: Development vs. Non-development in total expenditure.
- Sectoral Insights: Which areas get more funds (education, health vs. defense, interest payments).
- State vs. Central Government: Variation in expenditure priorities.

5. Visualization Ideas (for presentation/report)
- Line Chart â†’ Trend of both expenditures across years.
